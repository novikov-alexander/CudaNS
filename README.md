# CudaNS
Fast Dirichlet problem solver for the Poisson equation with second-order boundary conditions for an arbitrary object using a multigrid geometric method. It is employed in the advection step of solving the Navier-Stokes equation system.

## TODO
Implement native sparsity and add unified memory support.
